"""Competition program: shows a menu of all your missions on the hub.

Buttons:
    LEFT / RIGHT  — pick a mission (the number shows on the hub's screen)
    CENTER        — run the selected mission
    CENTER again  — stop a mission while it is running
    BLUETOOTH     — exit the menu

After a mission finishes, the menu automatically moves to the next one,
so during a match you can just keep pressing CENTER.

Add or reorder missions in menu_config.py — you don't edit this file.
This file just reads that list and builds the menu for you.
